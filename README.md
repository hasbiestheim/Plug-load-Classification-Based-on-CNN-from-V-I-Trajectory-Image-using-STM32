# Plug-load-Classification-Based-on-CNN-from-V-I-Trajectory-Image-using-STM32
we proposed deep learning architecture Convolutional neural networks (CNN) implementation on microcontrollers. 
The benefit of using implementation CNN load classification into a small microcontroller is lower power, lower cost, and more privacy compare to CPU/GPU with consideration of latency. 
Optimal CNN architecture can be obtained by using VI trajectory as feature extraction.  
The experimental result Plug-load inference can be run in the microcontroller STM32F4 with latency is 85.92 ms 
and 99% accuracy and will sufficient to run in real-world applications. 

Classification model will be run on the STM32F407VGT6 168MHz microcontroller board, 128 KB RAM, 1 MB Flash
